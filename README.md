# About the application
This application is a simple todo list with basic functionality to make a full CRUD app utilising RESTful routes.

This was my second solo project completed 4 days in week 6 of General Assembly's Software Engineering Immersive 12 week bootcamp.

The app is hosted on Heroku and can be accessed via this link: https://mytodolistbyjosh.herokuapp.com/list

## This application was built with
1. `HTML`
2. `CSS`
3. `Bootstrap`
4. `MongoDB`
5. `JavaScript`
6. `Mongoose`
7. `Express`
8. `EJS`
9. `Heroku`


## Basic Functionality
1. `Log in and log out`
    - Pages that contain lists and tasks require a recognized user ID to be logged in to view.
    - Passwords are encrypted.
2. `Add and remove tasks`
    - Create tasks, add information such as categories, level of priority and date due to be attributed to the specific task.
3. `Edit tasks`
    - Edit a task, all fields are changeable, however dates can not be set prior to the current date.
3. `Mark as complete and remove functionality`
    - Changing a tasks status to complete removes it from the general list, and can be viewed in the completed tasks section.
    - List items can be removed at any time.
4. `Filtering by category`
    - Filter by selecting a category, including the completed tasks.


# Planned future improvements

1. Have lists be specific to each user ID.
2. Improve UI.
